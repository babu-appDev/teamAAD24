## About The Project

### 1. ViewAnimation

This is the oldest type of animations. It was available since API 1. It has those 4 types of animations

    Alpha
    Scale
    Rotate
    Translate

And AnimationSet to wrap multiple animations. And you can call create them either from Java or XML. Here is an example from this repo [here](https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidViewAnimations).

### 2. Property Animation

Now letâ€™s get to more advanced stuff. This class was introduces in Android 3.0. Thatâ€™s a much bigger framework which allows to animate anything, not just views. First of all, I want to talk about some differences: it has default duration of 300 ms, if you animate views they stay at the animated position and default interpolator is AccelerateDecelerate. The root class  is Animator.

  * **Value Animator**

The main child in here is ValueAnimator it simply animates primitives like ints, floats, but for most cases you would want to apply those animated values to a view or any other objects. Thatâ€™s where you set AnimatorUpdateListener and set values to you objects on each callback

  * **Object Animator**

Rather then using ValueAnimator and setting update listener you can use ObjectAnimator, which handles it for you. It looks much cleaner with it.

  * **View Property Animator**

Finally we got to the one that most of you probably use most of all. Itâ€™s just like ObjectAnimator, but it performs better if you change multiple properties simultaneously by calling invalidate() after all properties are animated. You can animate by absolute value or starting from current one (+/-) using -By suffix. 

Here is an example of Property animations which you can check out [here](https://github.com/codepath/android-complex-property-animations-demo).

### 3. Drawable Animation

In addition to those above we have Drawable Animation. I know your hear exploding already. What, twelveâ€™s way to do fade out views, you might say? No, donâ€™t worry, this one actually differs from previous.  AnimationDrawable is more like 2D game development. Because itâ€™s frame drawable animation. For example, we have PNGâ€™s of running hero, for each frame we set its duration, put into list and set in to any view.

Here is an example of Drawable animations which you can check out [here](https://github.com/Sefford/CircularProgressDrawable).

### 4. Transitions
Android's transition framework allows you to animate all kinds of motion in your UI by simply providing the starting layout and the ending layout. You can select what type of animation you want (such to fade the views in/out or change the view sizes) and the transition framework figures out how to animate from the starting layout to the ending layout.

Here is an example of transitions which you can check out [here](https://github.com/kaichunlin/android-transition).
